When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are sharing work with more than one person?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is subjective, but you do not want to lose all the changes and commits?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is similar to a clone, just that this is the term used in github.
Clone is just cloning another repository. 
Branch is when you want to add a new feature without disturbing the working version.
