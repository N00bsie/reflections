It was easier to narrow down on the lines where the error could have been introduced.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file lets me capture errors faster or rollback changes easily.


Pros 

You know when to commit and what to commit. Not too many changes.


Cons 

Commits can be too big or too small.


-----------

Multi File Commits 

Because projects typically contain more than a single file.



---------------

git log is used to view the log of all commits

From there we can git diff with the commit ids to figure out the history of diffs between commits
